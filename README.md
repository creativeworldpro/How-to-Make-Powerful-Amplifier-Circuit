A power amplifier is an electronic device that increases the amplitude of an input signal to a level suitable for driving a load, such as a loudspeaker or a motor. It is designed to handle large amounts of power, typically in the range of watts to kilowatts, and deliver it to the load with minimal distortion. 

Power amplifiers are commonly used in audio systems, where they are responsible for driving the loudspeakers and providing the necessary power to reproduce the sound at high volumes.

They can also be found in other applications, such as radio frequency (RF) amplifiers, motor control circuits, and instrumentation amplifiers. The main characteristics of a power amplifier are its power output, efficiency, and distortion performance.

Different types of power amplifier designs are available, including Class A, Class B, Class AB, Class D, and Class G, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages. The choice of a power amplifier depends on the specific application requirements, such as power output, efficiency, distortion performance, and cost.

Transistor Pin Out - 

Tip 41 -

The pin arrangement may vary depending on the manufacturer or package type, but the pin functions remain the same.

1. Base

2. Collector

3. Emitter

The TIP41C is a general-purpose NPN transistor commonly used in power switching applications.

The emitter is connected to the ground, and the collector is connected to the load (such as a motor or a relay). The base is used to control the flow of current from the collector to the emitter.

It's important to note that the pinout may vary depending on the manufacturer or the packaging type of the transistor. Always refer to the datasheet for accurate pinout information.


2SC5200 -

The 2SC5200 is a high power NPN transistor commonly used in audio power amplifiers. Here is the pinout of the 2SC5200 transistor:

1. Base

2. Collector

3. Emitter

Step - 1 (Connect Resistor with Circuit)

To make this amplifier circuit, 1st we connect resistor with the transistor. We are using five resistors to build-up this circuit.

We connect 100 KΩ and 68 Ω resistor with "Base" leg of Tip41C transistor. Then connect 1K resistor with the "Collector" leg of 2SC5200 transistor.

Then we will connect wire wound resistor with the circuit. We connect one resistor with "Emitter" leg of TTA1943 transistor and another resistor with "Emitter" leg of 2SC5200 transistor. Now connect this resistor empty terminal with each other.


Step - 2 (Connect Capacitor with Circuit)

Now we need to connect capacitor with the circuit. To make this circuit we are using 2200µf/25v, 470µf/35v and 47µf/25v capacitor. First we connect 470µf/35v capacitor negative leg with "Base" leg of TTA1943 transistor and the capacitor positive leg with "Base" leg of 2SC5200 transistor.

Secondly we connect 2200µf/25v capacitor positive leg with 0.47Ω resistor and the capacitor negative leg will be connect with the speaker.

Then we connect the rest capacitor positive leg with the empty terminal of 68 Ω resistor and the capacitor negative leg will be connect with potentiometer ground leg.


Step - 3 (Connect Rectifier with Circuit)

This time, we will connect rectifier diode with the circuit. We connect one rectifier positive leg with "Base" leg of TTA1943 transistor and another rectifier negative leg with "Base" leg of 2SC5200 transistor.

Then connect both rectifier empty terminal with each other. You also need to connect Tip41C transistor "Collector" leg with "Base" leg of TTA1943 transistor.


Step - 4 (Connect Speaker with Circuit)

For output sound, we need to connect sound speaker with the circuit. We connect sound speaker one terminal with "Emitter" leg of Tip41C transistor and the rest terminal we connected 2200µf/25v capacitor negative leg.


Step - 5 (Connect Audio Source with Circuit)

For input audio, now we need to connect audio source with the circuit. For audio source, we are using mobile audio jack, for that we need to connect an audio input cable with the circuit. 

We connect audio input "L/R" cable with potentiometer input leg and audio input cable "G" cable with "Emitter" leg of Tip41C transistor.


Step - 6 (Connect Power Source with Circuit)

To complete total process, now we need to connect power source with the circuit. For power source we are using dual power supply with the circuit.

We connect power source "Positive" cable with "Collector" leg of 2SC5200 transistor, then connect "Negative" cable with "Collector" leg of TTA1943 transistor and connect power source "Ground" cable with "Emitter" leg of Tip41C transistor.


Soldering and Cleaning - 

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.
We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Last Step - Enjoy the Sound

Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Just plug-in power source and mobile with the amplifier circuit, then just play song on your mobile and enjoy the sound.
